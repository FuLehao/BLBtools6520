\title{Title: Scalable Subsampling Algorithm}
\usage{
ScaSub(data, beta, c1, u, xi)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector representing the dataset to be subsampled.}

\item{beta}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that determines the size of each subsample block as `b = n^beta`, where `n` is the length of the dataset.}

\item{c1}{A numeric value greater than 0 that controls the overlap between blocks. The stride length for block selection is `h = c1 * b`.}

\item{u}{A function that computes a point estimate (e.g., mean, median) from the data.}

\item{xi}{A function that calculates a statistic (e.g., confidence interval) based on the distribution of the root distances.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector representing the result of applying the statistic function `xi` to the root distances.
        For example, it may return confidence intervals.
}
\description{
This function implements a scalable subsampling algorithm, which divides the dataset into overlapping or non-overlapping blocks
of size `b` (controlled by `beta`) and computes statistics on each block. The function is particularly useful for estimating
confidence intervals for large datasets with reduced computational costs compared to full bootstrapping methods.

\examples{
# Example usage:
data <- rnorm(1000)  # Generate a dataset of 1000 random numbers
beta <- 0.5          # Subsample block size is n^beta, where n is the data length
c1 <- 0.2            # Stride length as a fraction of block size
u <- mean            # Point estimate function (mean)
xi <- function(root_dist, estimate) {
  quantile(root_dist, c(0.025, 0.975))  # 95\% confidence interval
}

result <- ScaSub(data, beta, c1, u, xi)
print(result)
