\title{Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) Algorithm}
\usage{
BLB(data, beta, s, r, u, xi)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector representing the data from which the resamples are drawn.}

\item{beta}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that controls the size of each bootstrap sample subset. The subset size is determined as `b = n^beta`, where `n` is the length of the data.}

\item{s}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap subsets to generate.}

\item{r}{An integer specifying the number of Monte Carlo samples to draw for each subset.}

\item{u}{A function that calculates a point estimate from the data (e.g., mean, median, etc.).}

\item{xi}{A function that computes a statistic, such as a confidence interval, based on the differences between point estimates for different resamples.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2, representing the average values of the statistic `xi` computed for different subsets.
        This could, for example, represent the lower and upper bounds of a confidence interval.
}
\description{
This function implements the Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB) algorithm, which is designed for scalable resampling of large datasets.
The algorithm resamples subsets of data, computes point estimates, and then calculates the uncertainty based on these resamples.
It is particularly useful for estimating confidence intervals for large datasets while minimizing computational overhead.

\examples{
# Example usage:
data <- rnorm(1000)  # Generate a sample of 1000 random numbers
beta <- 0.5          # Subset size is n^beta, where n is length of data
s <- 100             # Number of subsets to generate
r <- 500             # Number of resampling iterations per subset
u <- mean            # Point estimate function (mean)
xi <- function(resamples, estimate) {
  quantile(resamples, c(0.025, 0.975))  # 95\% confidence interval
}

result <- BLB(data, beta, s, r, u, xi)
print(result)
